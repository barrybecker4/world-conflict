World Conflict
================

A multi-player, online, Risk-like strategy game.

The original version was created for [JS13k 2014](http://js13kgames.com/) by Jakub Wasilewski. This project modifies that code in order to support multi-player online games using [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) (GAS). GAS is essentially Javascript which runs on a server.

## How to Run and Contribute

This is a [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) application. 
If you would like to contribute, first install [CLASP](https://github.com/google/clasp).
Next git clone this repository somewhere on your local machine. 

This project uses [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to persist data. You will need your own instance to run. Firestore is free for low usage limits. Create an instance and put the private key in `server/persistence/firestorePrivateKey.txt`. This file should _not_ be checked into git. 

Now, from the WorldConflict directory within the cloned project directory, run the following commands (first time only):
* `clasp login`  using gmail account
* `clasp create --type webapp` this creates a script with this name in your Google Drive
   after you do this, you will have a .clasp.json file locally with contents that look something like this <br>
   ```{"scriptId":"13Py0mZIfz-mg5F7KA0HcUH9vL2g4Q8ep416zi6qJmMfD5CA9AUiZ969K"}```
* `./push.sh`  push all the files in the project directory into that script in the cloud. Note: you may need to do `chmod +x` first on this file if on *nix. Normally you would use `clasp push`, but this script will duplicate some files for use on client and server before dong the normal `clasp push`. Note: do not commit the files that get copied or generate.
  
Now you are good to go! Deploy the web-app from your script on Google Drive.
Make changes locally (in IntelliJ for example), do `./push.sh` (as described above), and refresh the deployed app script page to see the change. 
Do git commit, push, and create pull requests through Github when you have a feature or fix to contribute.
 

#### Thanks

Thanks to Jakub Wasilewski for the initial compact Javascript implementation of the game.


#### TODO:

* If you join and don't like spot, you should be able to change your slot.
